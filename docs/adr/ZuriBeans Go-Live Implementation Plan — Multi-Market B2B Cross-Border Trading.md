# ZURIBEANS GO-LIVE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## Multi-Market B2B Cross-Border Trading on the Baobab Platform

**Programme:** ZuriBeans Production Go-Live  
**Platform:** Baobab  
**Tenant:** ZuriBeans  
**Business model:** B2B trading enterprise  
**Initial operating markets:** Uganda and South Africa  
**Future model:** N markets, N trade lanes, multiple product classes, multiple currencies, multiple logistics and customs providers  
**Primary architectural principle:** ZuriBeans shall be implemented as a provider-neutral, multi-market trading enterprise in which every authorised operating market may independently buy, sell, source, procure, import, export, warehouse, distribute and fulfil.

---

# 1. PURPOSE

The purpose of this plan is to move ZuriBeans from an increasingly capable set of Baobab components into a production-ready trading operation.

The programme shall prove that ZuriBeans can perform real commercial transactions across:

- suppliers;
- customers;
- markets;
- legal jurisdictions;
- currencies;
- warehouses;
- tax regimes;
- customs regimes;
- trade lanes;
- freight providers;
- payment mechanisms;
- accounting systems;
- digital estates.

The target is not merely to make the ZuriBeans website operational.

The target is to prove:

# 2. CORRECTED ZURIBEANS OPERATING MODEL

ZuriBeans shall not be designed around a fixed assumption such as:

```text
Uganda = source/export
South Africa = import/sell
```

That model is rejected.

Each authorised operating market may participate in several roles.

## 2.1 Uganda

ZuriBeans Uganda may:

- source Ugandan coffee;
- source vanilla or other products;
- procure locally;
- warehouse locally;
- sell to Ugandan B2B customers;
- export coffee to South Africa;
- export coffee to Kenya;
- export coffee to the UAE;
- export coffee to Europe;
- import South African wine;
- sell imported wine locally;
- buy from foreign suppliers;
- fulfil export orders directly from Uganda;
- receive stock transferred from another ZuriBeans operation.

## 2.2 South Africa

ZuriBeans South Africa may:

- source South African wine;
- source coffee or other products;
- procure locally;
- warehouse locally;
- sell locally;
- import coffee from Uganda;
- export wine to Uganda;
- export wine to other markets;
- fulfil customer orders directly;
- supply other ZuriBeans operations.

## 2.3 Future Markets

The architecture must therefore support:

```text
MARKET A
├── BUY
├── SELL
├── SOURCE
├── PROCURE
├── IMPORT
├── EXPORT
├── WAREHOUSE
├── DISTRIBUTE
└── FULFIL

MARKET B
├── BUY
├── SELL
├── SOURCE
├── PROCURE
├── IMPORT
├── EXPORT
├── WAREHOUSE
├── DISTRIBUTE
└── FULFIL

MARKET N
└── Any authorised combination
```

---

# 3. FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE

A market shall not have one fixed business role.

Instead:

> **Market participation is a set of capabilities.**

Conceptually:

```yaml
market_participation:
  market: UG

  capabilities:
    legal_presence: true
    sourcing: true
    procurement: true
    selling: true
    warehousing: true
    distribution: true
    importing: true
    exporting: true
```

and:

```yaml
market_participation:
  market: ZA

  capabilities:
    legal_presence: true
    sourcing: true
    procurement: true
    selling: true
    warehousing: true
    distribution: true
    importing: true
    exporting: true
```

Future markets may enable only subsets.

# 5. THREE TRANSACTION CLASSES

Baobab must distinguish at least three transaction classes.

## 5.1 Local Commercial Trade

Example:

```text
Ugandan Supplier
      ↓
ZuriBeans Uganda
      ↓
Ugandan Customer
```

Characteristics:

- domestic procurement;
- domestic tax;
- no international customs;
- domestic logistics;
- local settlement.

---

## 5.2 External Cross-Border Trade

Example:

```text
ZuriBeans Uganda
      ↓
Kenyan B2B Customer
```

Characteristics:

- export transaction;
- customs;
- origin;
- HS classification;
- international logistics;
- foreign tax/import consequences;
- potentially FX.

---

## 5.3 Internal Cross-Market Trade

Example:

```text
ZuriBeans Uganda
      ↓
ZuriBeans South Africa
```

This must not automatically be treated as a simple stock transfer.

The Control Plane and ERP must resolve whether the transaction represents:

```text
SAME LEGAL ENTITY
      │
      └── inter-branch / internal stock movement

DIFFERENT LEGAL ENTITIES
      │
      └── intercompany commercial transaction
```

This distinction affects:

- purchase orders;
- sales orders;
- invoices;
- AR;
- AP;
- revenue recognition;
- VAT;
- customs;
- transfer pricing;
- FX;
- stock ownership;
- due-to/due-from balances;
- consolidation;
- elimination entries.

### ADR REQUIRED

**ADR candidate: Intercompany and Inter-Branch Trading Model**

This ADR should define:

- legal entity relationship handling;
- intercompany order pairing;
- inventory ownership transfer;
- transfer pricing;
- due-to/due-from accounting;
- consolidation;
- elimination;
- FX treatment;
- tax and customs consequences.

---

# 6. TRADE LANE AS A FIRST-CLASS DOMAIN CONCEPT

The system must introduce a canonical Trade Lane model.

Conceptually:

```text
TradeLane
│
├── Origin Market
├── Destination Market
├── Seller Legal Entity
├── Buyer Legal Entity
├── Ship-From Location
├── Ship-To Location
├── Product Classification
├── Customs Regime
├── Tax Regime
├── Currency Rules
├── Allowed Incoterms
├── Transport Modes
├── Required Documents
├── Compliance Requirements
├── Insurance Requirements
├── Settlement Rules
└── Effective Dates
```

Examples:

```text
UG → ZA : Coffee
ZA → UG : Wine
UG → KE : Coffee
ZA → KE : Wine
UG → UAE : Coffee
ZA → UAE : Wine
```

A trade lane determines regulatory and operational context.

It does not determine commercial ownership by itself.

### ADR REQUIRED

**ADR candidate: Canonical Trade Lane Model**

---

# 7. DIGITAL ESTATES

ZuriBeans should initially operate several digital estates.

| Digital Estate | Primary users | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Buyer Portal | B2B buyers | Catalogue, RFQs, quotations, orders, shipment/invoice visibility |
| Supplier Portal | Suppliers | Registration, qualification, offers, documentation |
| Operations Portal | Staff | Procurement, trade execution, inventory, shipping, customs |
| Finance Console | Finance staff | AR/AP, payments, reconciliation, financial visibility |
| Management Console | Executives/managers | KPIs, margin, trade lane performance, risk |
| Administration | Administrators | Controlled configuration |

Some may share a frontend codebase.

They should nevertheless remain separate logical estate contexts.

- bindings;
- engine instances;
- context;
- isolation;
- readiness;
- provisioning.

## Trade

Owns commercial transaction orchestration.

### ADR REQUIRED

**Canonical Inventory Ownership, Location and In-Transit Model**

---

# 10.22 INVENTORY TITLE AND OWNERSHIP

Physical custody and legal ownership must be separable.

Example:

```text
Coffee
Physical Location: Freight Forwarder Warehouse
Legal Owner: ZuriBeans Uganda
Customs Status: Export Cleared
Commercial Status: In Transit
```

or:

```text
Wine
Physical Location: Durban Port
Legal Owner: Supplier
Customs Status: Pending Import Clearance
Commercial Status: Purchased Under CIF
```

The title transfer point can depend on the Incoterm.

# GATE ZB-27 — ADVERSARIAL TESTING

Attempt deliberately to:

- cross tenant boundaries;
- access another buyer organisation;
- access supplier-only data;
- access another market without entitlement;
- manipulate context headers;
- replay events;
- replay payments;
- reuse expired tokens;
- use revoked workloads;
- invoke another legal entity;
- alter shipment ownership;
- circumvent credit limits;
- inject unsupported currency;
- manipulate tax context;
- change price after quotation acceptance.

Every attack should fail safely.

# 24. WHAT SHOULD NOT DELAY RELEASE 1

Do not block ZuriBeans on:

- sophisticated AI recommendations;
- advanced commodity prediction;
- every possible logistics carrier;
- every global customs integration;
- every future product class;
- every potential market;
- Kubernetes;
- service mesh;
- advanced multi-region active-active;
- complex warehouse robotics;
- automated trade finance;
- blockchain;
- full transport management suite.

Design for extension.

Do not implement everything before launch.

---

# 25. WHAT ABSOLUTELY MUST NOT BE DEFERRED

These cannot be compromised:

```text
Tenant isolation

Legal-entity correctness

Buyer isolation

Supplier isolation

Accounting integrity

Inventory integrity

Pricing integrity

Tax correctness

Customs evidence

Canonical identity

Audit

Idempotency

Reconciliation

Security

Backup

Restore

Observability
```

---

# 26. FINAL TARGET STATE

ZuriBeans is ready for production when Baobab can execute this without architectural shortcuts:

```text

         ▼

         │
     Procurement

         │
         ▼

         │
         ▼
       Payment
         │
         ▼
      Accounting
```

while simultaneously supporting:

```text
Ugandan Coffee Supplier
         │
         ▼
 ZuriBeans Uganda
         │
         ├────────► Uganda Customer
         │
         ├────────► ZuriBeans South Africa
         │
         ├────────► Kenya Customer
         │
         └────────► Other Market
```

with the correct:

```text
Tenant
Legal Entity
Market
Counterparty
Trade Lane
Product
Inventory Ownership
Tax
Customs
Currency
Shipment
Accounting
Audit
```

context throughout the entire transaction.

---

# 27. PROGRAMME TEST

The programme should continually ask one question:

> **Can ZuriBeans buy, hold, move, import, export and sell goods in any authorised operating market—or between authorised markets—while preserving correct commercial, inventory, customs, tax, financial, security and accounting state from supplier to settlement?**

If the answer is not demonstrably yes, the relevant gate is not complete.

---

# 28. ARCHITECTURAL DISCIPLINE

Where implementation exposes ambiguity, do not silently decide in code.

Use:

```text
QUESTION
   ↓
ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS
   ↓
ADR
   ↓
APPROVED DECISION
   ↓
CANONICAL CONTRACT
   ↓
IMPLEMENTATION
   ↓
CONFORMANCE TEST
```

This should be particularly strict for:

- legal entities;
- intercompany trading;
- inventory ownership;
- tax;
- customs;
- pricing;
- trade lanes;
- supplier identity;
- counterparty identity;
- shipment ownership;
- document authority;
- ERP integration;
- market participation.

The purpose is not to produce more documentation for its own sake.

The purpose is to prevent local implementation decisions from becoming accidental Baobab architecture.
