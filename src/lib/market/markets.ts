/**
 * Candidate Baobab Market catalogue for the Zuribeans estate.
 *
 * These `marketKey` values mirror the candidate `canonical_key`s that
 * nabhold/baobab-trade's market bootstrap (`src/baobab/market/market-config.ts`)
 * uses to provision its own Medusa-side projection ahead of Control Plane
 * approval. `nabhold/shared`'s `contracts/legal-entity/registry.yaml` still
 * lists the ZURIBEANS entity's `markets` as empty pending that approval, so
 * these are candidates, not activated canonical Markets. Once Control Plane
 * registers and activates the real Markets, resolve this list against the
 * resulting `market_id`s rather than inventing a parallel identifier — do not
 * add a market here that Trade has not also bootstrapped under the same key.
